          My name is Ryan King, and I am the Owner/Managing Partner of Dogwood Moving. We are a locally
          owned Residential and Commercial moving company based out of Raleigh, NC. I was raised in
          Wilmington, NC until the age of 18 when I attended Queens University of Charlotte as a collegiate
          athlete. In that time, I began working for Hornet Moving and soon becoming the General Manager. After
          2 years, we ranked as one of the highest rated moving companies in North Carolina! The growing
          success and reputation led me to start Dogwood Moving.

          Here at Dogwood Moving, we promise to provide excellent customer service by getting the job done
          safely and efficiently. I have had a unique and rewarding perspective, working my way from mover to
          manager to owner. This has allowed me the opportunity to connect with our customers and staff alike
          and see the crucial connection between employee and customer. The happier your employees, the
          harder they will work, which will lead to a happier customer.
